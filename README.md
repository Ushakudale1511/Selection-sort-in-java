Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

**How it Works**

1)Start by considering the first element of the list as the minimum.

2Iterate through the rest of the list to find the actual minimum element.

3)If a smaller element is found, update the minimum element.

4)Once the minimum element is found, swap it with the first element of the unsorted part of the list.

5)Repeat steps 2-4 for the remaining unsorted part of the list.

Example

Suppose we have the following list of numbers: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

Start with the first element 64 as the minimum.
Iterate through the rest of the list and find the actual minimum 11.
Swap 11 with 64.
The list now becomes [11, 25, 12, 22, 64].
Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted part of the list.

Time Complexity
The time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2), making it less efficient than other sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort for large datasets. However, it has the advantage of being simple to implement and understand.

Use Cases
Selection sort is suitable for small datasets or educational purposes. It is not recommended for large-scale applications due to its poor performance.
